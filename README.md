# What features contribute to the Gross Box Office Earnings?

Many a time, people have faced this unavoidable problem: the movie has a poor ranking so should he or she see it regardless? While this problem may be trivial, our motivation for our project stems from figuring out what factors contribute to a box office movie. 

Is it the director, actors, production company, movie genre, or MPAA rating which heavily influence the gross? 


# Dataset: 
We obtained a dataset of 5,044 different movies and 28 quantitative features per each movie. Our main variable of interest is gross, which indicates if the movie was a hit or not. We are interested in determining which qualitative (or quantitative?) features are the best indicators for whether a movie faired well at the box office or not. Thus, our chosen attributes must be easily identifiable by the untrained moviegoer. We define the following variables with their corresponding potential value in our dataset:
